    <h1>Official TIXAN Project</h1>
    <h3>TIXAN is an experimental project with 
     the goal of creating a decentralized 
      corporation that enables anyone, 
      no matter their background, financial 
      situation, or country of origin to 
      create, contribute, and evaluate financial value.

      <strong>Max Total:</strong> 23,000,000 TXN<br>
      <strong>Initial price: </strong>23,000 TXN/1 gram of <strong>24K </strong> gold</p><br>
      <strong>Contributers are paid TXN based on: <br>Time spent and Agreed hourly rate (calculated based on the 24K gold price at the time of task completion) <br>although I don't want to take on a big project alone, if no contributers are found within 7 days (on July 22, 2023) I will commit my own time.</strong>
